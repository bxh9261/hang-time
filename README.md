# Hang Time
I created this game for the Wild MAGIC game jam at RIT on October 12th and 13th, 2019, with Justin Vaughn, Nathan Harding, and Ryan Montero

The game is a horror game, where the objective is to get through an asylum without being caught by the guards. The player has the ability to transport to an alternate dimension, where they are invisible to enemies and can walk through walls. However, the player can only be in this mode for a short amount of time before losing their sanity, so they must use their power sparingly.
      
This was my first time ever using Unreal, so I learned a lot about working with Unreal blueprints through a few VFX tutorials. I made the health indicator UI and designed the second level.
